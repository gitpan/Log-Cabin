Log-Cabin version 0.06
======================

Log::Cabin provides a selection of the features of Log::Log4perl but with 
a focus on reduced disk IO.  Just calling 'use Log::Log4perl' results in
hundreds of stat calls to the file system.  If you have a shared file system
with many nodes running perl scripts at once, this could result in a significant
decrease in performance.

After implementing this module we were able to cut up to 70,000 stat/open
calls per second on our NFS.  Of course, this module doesn't currently support
all the features of Log::Log4perl, but many of the most comment ones are
implemented.
